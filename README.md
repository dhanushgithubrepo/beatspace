Got it! Here's a **clean README draft** for your backend repo. It‚Äôs professional enough for GitHub, explains your future plans, and includes instructions to run locally or on Render. You can copy-paste and tweak if needed.

# BeatSpace Backend

**BeatSpace** is a mini social platform for music enthusiasts to create and join communities, share posts, and engage with other music lovers.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is a learning experiment and **not intended for production use**. It helped me understand **JWT authentication, REST APIs, and full-stack interaction**.

---

## Features

* **User Authentication**

  * Register and login using email/password
  * JWT-based authentication
  * Protected routes for creating communities and posts

* **Communities**

  * Create and list music communities
  * Users can join communities (optional in future)
  * Everyone can now post to communities (for learning/demo purposes)

* **Posts**

  * Create, view, and list posts within communities
  * Author tracking based on authenticated user

---

## Tech Stack

* Node.js & Express.js
* MongoDB (Atlas / local)
* JWT authentication
* CORS, body-parser, and other middlewares
* Deployed on [Render](https://render.com/)

---

## Future Improvements

* Enforce proper membership before posting
* Like, comment, and share posts
* Search communities and posts
* Add user profile pages and avatars
* Real-time notifications via WebSockets
* Proper error handling and logging for production

---

## Setup Locally

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/beatspace-backend.git
   cd beatspace-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root folder:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
   ```

4. **Run the server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend should now run on `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Deployment

* The backend is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) and accessible at:

  ```
  https://beatspace.onrender.com
  ```
* The frontend connects to this endpoint for API requests.

---

## API Endpoints (Summary)

* `POST /auth/register` ‚Äì Register a new user

* `POST /auth/login` ‚Äì Login and get JWT

* `GET /auth/me` ‚Äì Get logged-in user info

* `GET /communities` ‚Äì List all communities

* `POST /communities` ‚Äì Create a community (auth required)

* `GET /communities/:name` ‚Äì Get a specific community

* `POST /communities/:name/posts` ‚Äì Create a post in a community (auth required)

* `GET /communities/:name/posts` ‚Äì List posts in a community

---

## Notes

* This project was primarily a **learning exercise** in **backend development, authentication, and API design**.
* All features are simplified for educational purposes.
* The project helped me understand how **frontend and backend communicate using JWT and fetch**.
